Huge update!

First off, improved stability and performance (I think). I fixed many random crash bugs and obscure bugs.

Secondarily, new features! Even more mod integrations and such, completely new mods, etc. etc. Everything you'd expect from a modpack update.

Biggest change is to Hardcore mode - removed permadeath, but increased overall threat level, with mobs getting smarter and having better AI and world generation being less friendly overall. This is part one of many features I planned for Hardcore mode in ADJ, which at some point will include Hardcore-mode exclusive content. The idea for the mode is to be a higher risk higher reward mode, as opposed to high risk no reward mode it is in vanilla (and every single modpack by extension).
