Introducing new equipment layouts! Terraria style.

Press F1, F2, F3 to quickly change equipped armor and accessories to a different preset of yours.

**In order to smoothly update from older versions, go into `config` folder and delete `default_key_setup-client.toml`.** This will unfortunately reset all of your keybinds if you set them to something different, but will prevent any conflicts with new loadout feature.
