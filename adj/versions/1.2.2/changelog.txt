Mostly just balance changes. And even more stability! Maybe performance, but just maybe.

------

**[Mod changes]**

- Fixed EMI being exported in Edit Mode
- Fixed entity.zombieawareness.scent sometimes being shown in JEI.
- Zombies and similar entities no longer make awful noises when targetting you.
- Zombified Piglins no longer aggro randomly.
- Switched Colorwheel back to Irix x Flywheel compat due to significant performance differences.
- Replaced Sodium Dynamic Lights with RyoamicLights, fixing the random Aether crashes once and for all (I hope).
- Removed Elvenwood as it served no purpose outside of being an extra step.
- Removed the ATL warning in chat upon reaching 90% RAM usage. It isn't harmful and doesn't impact much other than occasional stutters, so the message was just confusing.

**[Balance changes]**

- Reworked Steel gear to be chapter 1 armor set and not chapter 0 (Steel Ingot recipe now requires Blaze Powder).
> Total armor defense increased (21 -> 26).
> Full set bonus gives more damage reduction (5% -> 10%).
> Steel gear base damage increased (17 -> 26), reduced base attack speed (1.6 -> 1.25).
> Chestplate and Leggings now decrease movement speed by 6% each.

- Reworked Terrasteel to be chapter 3 armor set and not chapter 0 diamond sidegrade
> All recipes now use Hallowed Alloy.
> Increased Terra Blade damage (21 -> 37), making it slightly weaker than Adamantite Sword (38). Gave it 20 armor penetration.
> Terra Truncator and Terra Shatterer recipes remain UNCHANGED. Same applies to other items crafted with them, making only the gear post-Aether

- Reworked Stormyx, it is now an alloy made with Raw Stormyx, Zanite and Amethyst Dust.
> Moved from chapter 1 to chapter 2, buffed accordingly.
> Added set bonus: grants a short ranged dash, 10% chance to avoid incoming damage

- Mythril and Orichalcum gear durability reduced (2500 -> 2000).
- Reduced Mythril tools base damage (23 -> 16).
- Reduced Orichalcum tools base damage (23 -> 22).
- Reduced Elementium gear damage (25 -> 22).
- Reduced Manasteel gear damage (17 -> 15).
- Nerfed Pitchfork damage (29 -> 16)
- Diamond armor total defense reduced (26 -> 23).
- Reduced Warglaive damage multiplier (0.8x -> 0.7x).
- Reduced Warglaive attack range (2.6 -> 2.2)
- Removed Cutlasses.
- Shuffled numbers for Witches, Vindicators, Pillagers.
- Scythe damage multiplier increased (1.2x -> 1.35x).
- Glaive damage multiplier increased (1.15x -> 1.2x) and increased attack speed (1.2 -> 1.3).
- Spear attack speed increased (1.1 -> 1.2).
The idea is that Scythes and Glaives have higher DPS than other weapons at the cost of being two handed, while spears are sort of a sidegrade to swords - trading attack speed for extra range.
- Katanas have a new effect - landing a 3 hit combo increases movement speed for a short while.
- Manasteel gear has 10% more attack speed.
- Eye of Verdant Bloom is slightly easier to craft.
- Increased Wolf HP (40 -> 100) and gave them 4 defense points by default.
- Reduced Sabrewing damage (30 -> 27)
- Buffed Heavy Crossbow and Slayer Crossbow damage.

**[Other]**

- Fixed vanilla Chests and Shields still being used in some recipes, making them uncraftable.
- Fixed Free The End being granted for holding a Dragon Head rather than killing the Ender Dragon.
- Mobs can no longer deal critical strikes (why was that even a thing)...
- ...but mobs in hardcore have a 10% chance to critically strike the player.
- Fixed Nature's Compass only needing a 10th of a Mana Pool to craft (it's supposed to be an entire Mana Pool due to balancing reasons).
- Fixed multiplayer servers sometimes not giving progress to all players (fix doesn't apply backwards, progress to next chapter to fix for everyone! Or do /adjresetprogress)
- Fixed Chapter 4 not being progressed to properly, causing some players to be unable to enter The End (probably also not backwards compatible, didn't test if it is).
