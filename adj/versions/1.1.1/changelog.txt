------

**[Other]**

- Fixed Rose Gold Alloy having no crafting recipe.
- Fixed Atlas having no crafting recipe.
- (from 1.0.0) Fixed Atlas stating it has 9 empty maps when crafted while in reality it had 0.
- Finally fixed the Diamond Upgrade Smithing Template having no texture (CurseForge export did a funky twice).
- Fixed Crimson and Warped Drawers showing up in EMI. 
- Fixed unavailable (chapter-locked) items showing in EMI. This comes at a price, as emi takes significantly longer to load now in comparison.
- Fixed Creative-only items showing in EMI.
- Unified Honey liquids (previously there was Honey Fluid from The Bumblezone and Honey from Create, now it's just the first one).
