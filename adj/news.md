### 1.2.0

If you're reading this, new ADJ update 1.2.0 is either about to release or has already done so. Enjoy better stability and plenty of new features and improvements!

### Vote in CF Mod Jam!!

Also, this is a good moment to mention that my other project - [**CRAFTDIS**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/craftdis) (click to see) - was qualified for CurseForge's Mod Jam 2025 "Forge The Future"! If you want to support me, you can vote for it as a community favorite [**HERE**](https://overwolfdevs.typeform.com/to/PgcnXSRD). CRAFTDIS is in a later category - Data Packs - so you will have to click a bit to get to it. Every vote counts!! If my project wins the community favorite, I'll add the top voted feature on my Discord to ADJ!
