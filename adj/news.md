Had to move this one up cause nobody realized you can scroll the news box.
If you see this, &lsend me your username&r! I'll add you to the list of people elligible for a special tester cape! Yes, it will be visible for everyone playing the modpack.


## Blind testing notes:

This is an EARLY version. Most of the stuff is finished gameplay-wise, but bugs may arise. Proceed with caution and make frequent backups (automatic backups only store the last 3 hours of your gameplay!).

I tried to make it enjoyable and fun. Please go easy with criticism, but don't be too light - I need solid opinions on how everything feels and plays.

Also, please don't post screenshots or have any conversations outside of the blind testing category on Discord - I want to keep the content as a surprise for the rest of the community until release!

## Multiplayer notice

There is no official server for the modpack and there is no server pack for a few reasons. 

You can select `Host World` in-game to open the world for anyone to join. If you want to send the early modpack to e.g. your friends to play with, feel free to do so. Just don't send it to #general and you're good to go!
