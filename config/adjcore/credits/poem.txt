You picked up the Architect's Prism.

It's supposed to be a myth. Yet there it is, in all of its long-forgotten glory.


In the same moment, you felt overwhelmed by its sheer power.

It's in your head. It's whispering things in a language you've never heard before.

You don't understand a word. Only thing you know is that it wants to be used. You feel it in every bit of your body.



You start to think of its past creations.


You imagine huge cities, bustling with life, filled with abundance.

You think of all the magical ingredients, used in crafting cures for every ailment.

You picture all the sorcerers, doing extensive research on the Prism's origins and capabilities.


Your thoughts suddenly jump to the Wither Storm, the destroyer of worlds.

You realize this artifact is not a toy. Far from it.


In hands of a good, trustworthy person, it's a tool.

If wielded by a twisted mind, it's a weapon.



The sorcerers are long deceased. 

There is nobody who could match its power even in the sligthest.


Are you going to use the all mighty power of the Architect's Prism to create?

Or are you going to send this realm into destruction?


Whatever choice you make, there is nobody to stop you.

This world belongs to you now.
