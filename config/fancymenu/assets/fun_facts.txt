The development for this pack started all the way back in February 2025 after kohara was in the middle of his playthrough through the Beyond Depth modpack. His motivation - 'I can do better' (this is by no mean a Beyond Depth slander)
The ultimate goal of this modpack is to get enough traction for kohara to release his own plushie. Literally.
