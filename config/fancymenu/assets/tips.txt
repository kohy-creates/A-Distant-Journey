Unbreaking enchantment doubles an item's maximum durability.
Mobs can notice you from further away and are a lot smarter than in Vanilla, so think twice before diving into a horde of Zombies.

During Slimy Moons, Slimes will spawn everywhere on the surface. Great if you need plenty of Slime Balls.
Every season lasts 30 in-game days, or about 8 real life hours.

Jumping down on your target no longer critically hits. Critical chance now scales based on a few factors, including (but not limited to) your EXP level.

Remember to take breaks while playing!
Place down an Inventory Connector and attach a Storage Terminal to it to create a basic and infinitely expandable storage system.
Loot chests in structures can be looted by every player in your world, not just whoever finds them first.
Nights are very dark in ADJ, so make sure you're always carrying a Torch or a Lantern with you at all time.
An easy way to generate lots of Mana that requires minimum resources and upkeep are Hydroangeas.
Thermalillies generate a lot of Mana while they are active, but go on a 5 minute cooldown afterwards. The amount of energy generated outweights the cooldown though.
